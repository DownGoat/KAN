Kippo Abuse Notifier

Parses the main kippo log file, and tries to send a abuse e-mail to the registar of the IP.

It saves the parsed data, so it will not send the same complaint more than once.
It also supports a whitelist of IPs too not report. Would be stupid to report yourself.

Currently it only supports sending e-mail with a gmail account.

Requirements:
 Python 3.3 +
 ipwhois
